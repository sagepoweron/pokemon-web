# Description
This application was created to help people view and compare Pokemon stats for competitive battling. Find Pokemon on the search page, view detailed charts and tables for each Pokemon on their individual info page, and add Pokemon to a compare list to see how their stats compare to one another on the compare page.

## Features
- This application makes calculations based on the Pokemon's base stats which are stored in arrays. This data is also displayed in charts and tables on different pages.
- The base stats are used in calculating the actual stats of a Pokemon using user inputs for the level, nature, effort values, and inherited values. These calculations are based on the formulas used in the latest games.
- ChartJS is used for the radar chart on the info page of each Pokemon. A radar chart was chosen because it is similar to the charts found in the games.
- This app uses local storage to store the compare list and allow it to be accessed on both the search and compare pages.
- This app was created using React and TypeScript.
