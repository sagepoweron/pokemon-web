# Description
This application was created to help people view and compare Pokemon stats for competitive battling. Find Pokemon on the search page, view detailed charts and tables for each Pokemon on their individual info page, and add Pokemon to a compare list to see how their stats compare to one another on the compare page.

## Features
1. Analyze data that is stored in arrays, objects, sets or maps and display information about it in your app.

- This application makes calculations based on the Pokemon's base stats which are stored in arrays. This data is also displayed in charts and tables on different pages.

2. Create a function that accepts two or more input parameters and returns a value that is calculated or determined by the inputs.

- The base stats are used in calculating the actual stats of a Pokemon using user inputs for the level, nature, effort values, and inherited values. These calculations are based on the formulas used in the latest games.

3. Visualize data in a user friendly way.

- ChartJS is used for the radar chart on the info page of each Pokemon. A radar chart was chosen because it is similar to the charts found in the games.

4. Persist data to an internal API an dmake the stored data accessible in your app.

- This app uses local storage to store the compare list and allow it to be accessed on both the search and compare pages.

5. Develop your project using a common JavaScript framework such as React.

- This app was created using React and TypeScript.
